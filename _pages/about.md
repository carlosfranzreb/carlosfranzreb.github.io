I'm a researcher at DFKI and a third-year PhD student at TU Berlin.
My research focuses on speaker anonymization, i.e. how can speaker information be concealed in a speech signal, while preserving its utility.
How utility is defined depends on the use case.
At DFKI we work with therapists from Charit√© University to develop [a real-time anonymizer](https://www.isca-archive.org/tmp/archive/spsc_2024/franzreb24_spsc.pdf) that can be used for therapy.
This use case requires the anonymized speech to be expressive, for therapists to fully understand what their patients convey to them.

In the past I've also worked on accented speech recognition and NLP topics like [knowledge graphs](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Le-Tuan-Anh/publication/362727453_Towards_Building_Live_Open_Scientific_Knowledge_Graphs/links/6332c587694dbe4bf4c645f6/Towards-Building-Live-Open-Scientific-Knowledge-Graphs.pdf) and subject indexing.
