Yesterday I gave a lecture on speaker anonymization at the [biometrics seminar at TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/qu/study-and-teaching/course-offer/courses/sommersemester/biometric-identification-verification).
My aim was to give a broad introduction to the field, explaining the core ideas and challenges, and providing relevant references.
I was allowed to record it; you can find a link to the video below, as well as the link to a compact version of the slides.
Hopefully, newcomers to the field find this overview helpful to get started.
If you find errors of any kind, please let me know and I will update the material.
